# SimpleSlotMachine

**This is a simple slot machine program that asks for your deposited amount you want to bet, how many lines you would like to bet on and how much you want to bet on each line.
It then calculates your winnings by checking the different symbols, or in this case characters and their values multiplied by the bet.**
